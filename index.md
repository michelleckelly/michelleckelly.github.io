## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="https://github.com/michelleckelly.png">

Hi, I'm Michelle! I'm an aquatic ecosystem ecologist. I work to better understand nutrient cycling in rivers and streams, with the ultimate goal of mitigating downstream pollution. My research sits at the intersection of traditional biogeochemistry approaches and modern data science-driven analytical techniques. 

I am a current Masters student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Kansas. I recieved my BS in Environmental Engineering at Michigan Technological University in 2017.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, camping, and baking. I also have a very fluffy cat named Charlie.
