## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="https://github.com/michelleckelly.png">

Hi! I am a second year Master's student working with Dr. Amy Burgin and the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department of the University of Kansas. I received my Environmental Engineering BS in 2017 at Michigan Technological University. 

## Research Interests

My research fields are aquatic biogeochemistry, ecology, and data science. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding nutrient processing and metabolism in streams and rivers with numerical modeling techniques.
