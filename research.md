**High supply, high demand: A unique nutrient addition decouples nitrate uptake and metabolism in a large river.**  
_Masters Thesis, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Kansas._  
_Mentor: Dr. Amy J. Burgin, funded by NSF DEB-Ecosystems RAPID #1822960 to Dr. Lydia H. Zeglin and Dr. Amy J. Burgin._

**Exploring within-reach variation in nitrogen cycling processes.**  
_NSF REU, Michigan Technological University. In collaboration with A. Marcarelli and K. Nevorski._  
Do small-scale bottle assays reflect reach-scale nitrogen cycling dynamics? We explored the variation in bottle assay estimates of nitrification and denitrification along an upstream to downstream sampling gradient. Furthermore, we contrasted the differences in variation between sites with relatively low, moderate, or high discharge.
